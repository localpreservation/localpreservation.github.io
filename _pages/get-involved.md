We are using [GitHub](http://github.com) as a platform for developing and sharing lessons and tutorials. To contribute online, we encourage you to [join GitHub](https://github.com/join) and learn more about [how to use GitHub](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/). Using GitHub, you can contribute online in two ways:

- **Comment on issues.** Do you have suggestions for new lessons? Or comments on existing lessons? We are using the [issue tracker on our main repository](https://github.com/localpreservation/localpreservation.github.io/issues) to share questions and opportunities for comment. Learn more about [using issues on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
- **Make changes or additions to lessons or resources.** GitHub makes it simple to "fork" an existing repository, make changes, and then contribute those changes back to the project. Learn more about [forking projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

You can add issues or contributions to our collection of [related resources](https://github.com/localpreservation/resources).
