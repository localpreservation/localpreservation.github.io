## What are open educational resources?

All the resources we publish are **open**. There are many different definitions for open educational resources (often abbreviated as OERs). All of our resources:

- are available at **no cost** to educators and learners
- can be **modified** by educators and learners
- can be **redistributed** by educators who have made changes to the original work

Learn more about OERs from [An Introduction to Open Education Resources](http://b7jl.org/oer/) or [read our guide](/open-education/) to creating open educational resources.

## How can you use these resources?

If you are new to historic preservation, you can use our resources as self-guided courses to learn more about a range of topics including research and writing, organizing and advocacy, and neighborhood preservation planning.

<!-- TODO: We need to add a suggested list of tutorials for beginning preservationists. -->

If you are an experienced volunteer or a preservation professional, you can use our resources as a foundation to create your own workshops or trainings for board members, fellow volunteers, or other residents within your community.

<!-- TODO: We need to add a suggested list of resources that are useful to people who want to teach rather than learn. -->

## How can you improve these resources?

We need your help to continue improving and expanding our collection of educational resources. This site and all of our resources are published using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). These tools are used to make it easy for people to work together on open source software projects but can also be used to work together to build websites like our educational resources.

Please submit your questions, suggestions, and corrections [as issues on our primary repository](https://github.com/localpreservation/localpreservation.github.io/issues). You can also fork any of the [repositories created by the Local Preservation School](https://github.com/localpreservation/), make changes, and then submit a pull request. Learn more about [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) on GitHub.
