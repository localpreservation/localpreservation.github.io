## Take a course online

We are developing a series of short courses and workshops where you can learn skills and concepts related to historic preservation.

## Attend a class or workshop

Our first class takes place in Baltimore in June and July 2016. We are also planning workshops for New York in September 2016 and Philadelphia in October 2016. Stay tuned for more details soon!

## Read our handbook

We are also compiling a variety of resources using Google Sheets and GitHub. We plan to compile these resources into a "handbook" that can serve as a reference for anyone taking our courses. Check our our [handbook](https://github.com/localpreservation/handbook) and [resources](https://github.com/localpreservation/resources) repositories on GitHub for more information.
