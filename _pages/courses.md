We are developing a series of short courses and workshops where you can learn skills and concepts related to historic preservation.

## Local Data 101

A course on making maps, visualizations, seeing trends and patterns in data about historic places and the past. Follow the [Local Data 101 GitHub repo](https://github.com/localpreservation/localdata101) for updates.

## Preservation Advocacy 101

A course on the nuts-and-bolts of nonprofit advocacy for historic buildings and neighborhoods. We developed [a prototype of this course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1McW7XeO_7oqkcGDgVXcaXOR62kbRzyrb3yir_PSUMsI/edit?usp=sharing) for a Baltimore Heritage board training in March 2016. The training was based on the [Baltimore Heritage advocacy guide](https://github.com/baltimoreheritage/guides/blob/master/advocacy-guide.md) published in November 2015.
