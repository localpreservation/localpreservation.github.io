## About this timeline

Understanding the history of historic preservation and the related work of public history and archaeology can help us understand how the skills and concepts we plan to teach through the Local Preservation School have developed and changed. We are currently developing an accessible timeline overview of the history of preservation based on Beyond Preservation: Using Public History to Revitalize Inner Cities (2010) and Giving Preservation a History: Histories of Preservation in the United States (2004). This timeline was created using [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and the free, open-source [Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) timeline builder from the [KnightLab Publisher's Toolbox](https://projects.knightlab.com/#toolbox)

## Help make this timeline better

If you have suggestions for this timeline or ideas for how we should teach the history of historic preservation, please consider sharing your comments on the [source Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l2d4wjWhKNHvbJPllk9PyTBKKvbXr0XXFoh6jFGLsOs/edit?usp=sharing) or reaching on Twitter to [@localpast](http://twitter.com/localpast/) or [@elipousson](http://twitter.com/elipousson/). You can also make a copy of the spreadsheet to start creating a timeline history of historic preservation and public history efforts in your own community using [Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/).
