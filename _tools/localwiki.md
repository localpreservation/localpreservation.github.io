title: LocalWiki
excerpt: "LocalWiki is a grassroots effort to collect, share and open the world’s local knowledge. They want anyone, anywhere to be able to learn about where they live — their local government, the history of their neighborhoods, streets, social movements, noteworthy local figures, social services, schools — every facet of life in their community. They believe that this vast collection of local knowledge should be created by the people who know it best — individual community members working together."
