## What is open education?

[Open Education Week](http://www.openeducationweek.org/what-is-open-education/) defines open education in this way:
>Open education encompasses resources, tools and practices that employ a framework of open sharing to improve educational access and effectiveness worldwide.
>Open Education combines the traditions of knowledge sharing and creation with 21st century technology to create a vast pool of openly shared educational resources, while harnessing today’s collaborative spirit to develop educational approaches that are more responsive to learner’s needs.

## What is an open educational resource (OER)

This broad definition of OERs from [OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/about) seems to be generally accepted by most educators working on this topic:

>'Open educational resources are teaching and learning materials that are freely available online for everyone to use, whether you are an instructor, student or self-learner. Examples of OER include: full courses, course modules, syllabi, lectures, homework assignments, quizzes, lab and classroom activities, pedagogical materials, games, simulations, and many more resources contained in digital media collections from around the world.'
