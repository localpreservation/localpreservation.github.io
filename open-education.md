# Open Education

## What is open education?

[Open Education Week](http://www.openeducationweek.org/what-is-open-education/) defines open education in this way:
>Open education encompasses resources, tools and practices that employ a framework of open sharing to improve educational access and effectiveness worldwide.
>Open Education combines the traditions of knowledge sharing and creation with 21st century technology to create a vast pool of openly shared educational resources, while harnessing today’s collaborative spirit to develop educational approaches that are more responsive to learner’s needs.

## What is an open educational resource (OER)

This broad definition of OERs from [OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/about) seems to be generally accepted by most educators working on this topic:

>'Open educational resources are teaching and learning materials that are freely available online for everyone to use, whether you are an instructor, student or self-learner. Examples of OER include: full courses, course modules, syllabi, lectures, homework assignments, quizzes, lab and classroom activities, pedagogical materials, games, simulations, and many more resources contained in digital media collections from around the world.'

# Additional Background

[Guide to Open Licensing – Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/guide/)

- **What is an open license?** A license is a document that specifies what can and cannot be done with a work (whether sound, text, image or multimedia). It grants permissions and states restrictions. Broadly speaking, an open license is one which grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with few or no restrictions.
- **Why use an open license?** Works that are published without an explicit license are usually subject to the copyright laws of the jurisdiction they are published in by default. Open licenses enable creators to allow more freedom in what others can do with their works.
- **How can I apply an open license?** Applying an open license to a work can be very straightforward. The procedure may slightly vary depending on which license is selected.
