title: Our first month of work on the Local Preservation School   
---

We’ve had an exciting few weeks ramping up our work on the Local Preservation School. This is the first of our regular updates on what we’re working on, reading, writing and finding online as we explore the possibilities of open online education for historic preservation.

Please share your ideas and suggestions for resources or tools we should include in future updates! We’d also love to hear from you about the project—[get in touch](http://localpreservation.github.io/contact/) with questions or suggestions or find us on Twitter at [\#localpast](https://twitter.com/hashtag/localpast?src=hash) or [@localpast](http://twitter.com/localpast).

## Writing a grant application—due tomorrow!

We are applying to the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training for a [2016 Media Grant](https://ncptt.nps.gov/grants/2016-ncptt-media-grants-program/) to help support the development of our online educational resources. If our application is successful, we hope to use the funding to pay for additional technical assistance for web development and instructional design. Please take a look at our [project description](http://localpreservation.github.io/2016-ncptt-media-grant/#local-preservation-school-project-description) (a work in progress) the new step-by-step guide we put together on [how to apply for a grant](http://localpreservation.github.io/2016-ncptt-media-grant/#how-do-you-apply-for-a-grant). Writing a grant in four days is not the best way to do it—but it is a common experience for many small nonprofit organizations.

## Starting with Explore Baltimore Heritage 101

In October, we started working on the very first draft of our [Explore Baltimore Heritage 101](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/explore-101/) course. We’re developing a set of lessons on how to research and write about historic places in Baltimore. These lessons build on our resources we developed last year for our [Explore Baltimore Heritage](explore.baltimoreheritage.org) (Please check it out if you haven’t seen it before!) and give us a place to experiment as we continue learning how to use GitHub as a platform for publishing educational resources. You can also read more about [how we’re using GitHub and Jekyll](http://localpreservation.github.io/blog/how-to-open-education-jekyll-github-pages/) along with the Peer 2 Peer University [Course-in-a-Box Jekyll template](http://howto.p2pu.org/) to power the Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 course.

## Creating a timeline view of preservation history

We also put together a timeline history of [Preservation, Public History and Archaeology.](http://localpreservation.github.io/timeline/) Understanding the history of historic preservation is critically important to understanding how historic preservation works. We created this visual, interactive timeline with [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and the free, open-source[Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) timeline builder from the [KnightLab Publisher's Toolbox](https://projects.knightlab.com/#toolbox). So far we’ve based our timeline of preservation, public history and archaeology history is based on Beyond Preservation: Using Public History to Revitalize Inner Cities (2010) and Giving Preservation a History: Histories of Preservation in the United States (2004). You can help improve this resource by sharing your comments and suggestions on our [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l2d4wjWhKNHvbJPllk9PyTBKKvbXr0XXFoh6jFGLsOs/edit?usp=sharing). Special thanks to [David Rotenstein](https://twitter.com/iVernacular) for his great suggestions on the first draft.

**Next City:** [How a Not-Entirely-Polite Card Game Is Changing Urban Planning](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/cards-against-urbanity-new-game-for-urban-planners) by [Rachel Kaufman](https://twitter.com/rkaufman), October 20, 2015

> “When a pilot takes off, they have a checklist,” says Abbey Oklak, a planner and architect and another Do Tank member. “That’s how I see these cards. As you’re doing a planning process, there’s all these competing interests that you have to look at. Having these cards laid out in front of you gives you that checklist to make sure that as you’re going through the design process, you’re not forgetting anything.”

> There is no question that new construction creates an immediate emissions deficit while the payback period is calculated in decades. A 2012 report by the National Trust for HistoricPreservation, in partnership with Skanska and the Cascadia Green Building Council, found that it can take between 10 and 80 years for even an energy-efficient new building to overcome, through cleaner operations, the climate change impacts created by its construction. These are precious decades we cannot afford.

> The Place Matters Toolkit is a guidebook to help you identify, promote, and protect places that you care about. […] If asked, each of us could probably point to public places in our city that connect us to the past, sustain thriving communities, contribute diversity and distinctiveness to our surroundings, and add to our well being.
> But most of us are never asked.

**Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail**: [Ranger Kenny Points shows us the "Art of Pointing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b124VEvrK7o)
> Ranger Kenny Points of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail discusses some tips and tricks to pointing for park rangers. Various techniques covered include pointing for beginners, pointing with objects, the lean point, the tap point, the jump point, the crouch point, as well as some of the pitfalls and dangers of pointing.

Don’t forget the dangers of pointing at nothing and over pointing!

**BoingBoing**: [Beautiful, free/open 3D printed book of lost Louis H. Sullivan architectural ornaments](http://boingboing.net/2015/11/01/9beautiful-freeopen-3d-print.html). Artist Tom Burtonwood writes:

> "Twenty Something Sullivan is a collaboration with City of Chicago Cultural Historian Tim Samuelson and features nine 3D scans of hitherto lost Louis H. Sullivan architectural ornament produced early in his career - hence the title of the book. It is a circular book - which is a little unusual - but necessary in order to show off the scans in high relief as Sullivan intended them to be seen.
