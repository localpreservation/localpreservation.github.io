We are excited to share an update on our brand-new [resource directory](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/) and our growing [tool library](https://localpreservation.github.io/tools/). This varied collection of publications, toolkits, software recommendations, and subject guides includes:

- Classic National Park Service publications adapted for the web:
  - [Maintaining the Exterior of Small and Medium Size Historic Buildings](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/maintaining-exteriors/)
  - [Understanding Old Buildings: The Process of Architectural Investigation](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/architectural-investigation/)
- Guides and toolkits by local and national preservation advocacy organizations:
  - [Place Matters Toolkit](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/placematters/) from CityLore in New York City
  - [Community Preservation Guide](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/community/) based on publications from the National Trust for Historic Preservation
- Essential links and resources from related fields such as urban design, place-making, community archiving, and more:
  - [How to Do Creative Placemaking](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/how-to-creative-placemaking/)
  - [Culture in Transit Toolkit](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/culture-in-transit/)
  - [Tactical Urbanist’s Guide to Materials & Design](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/tactical-urbanism-guide/)
  - [Building Technology Heritage Library](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/building-technology-heritage-library/)

Now, we need your help. We are asking you to join our [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review) of the resources and tools we've gathered so far and to let us know what we're missing.

Here is what we're asking:

1. **Explore the directory**: [Take a look](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/). Pick one or two links and look them over. You can filter by topic or browse by [publication year](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/year/) or [tag](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/tag/).
2. **Reflect on a resource**: Did you like the resources you read? Are they useful? Do you have any suggestions about how we can  improve these resources? Do you know any related resources we should add to the directory?
3. **Share your feedback**: Send us your comments and feedback [by email](mailto:pousson@baltimoreheritage.org) or by using a new tool called [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/).

You can read about how people are using Hypothesis for [scholarly peer review](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/09/22/annotations-as-peer-review-an-interview-with-maryann-martone-of-hypothes-is/) and for [critiquing media coverage of climate science](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/02/critiquing-climate-coverage) but we think this is the first time anyone is using the tool for preservation education. We've set up our site so you'll sometimes see the Hypothesis sidebar pop-up at the edge of your screen, e.g. [Understanding Old Buildings](https://localpreservation.github.io/resources/architectural-investigation/). You can review or comment on any part of our website _or_ on any of our recommended resources with [the Hypothesis Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek).  Either way, please try it out and tag your public annotations with our [\#localpast hashtag](https://hypothes.is/search?q=tag%3A%23localpast) so we can find and incorporate your feedback. You can also keep your annotations private by joining our [Local Preservation School Hypothesis group](https://hypothes.is/groups/AozKGLY6/local-preservation-school).

If you’re still not sure how to use Hypothesis, try [watching a video tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmuJEyeapl2eznT3UHbLxuaQJaulzKHVZ) or read the [quick start guide for students](https://hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/).

We'll be collecting _all_ the feedback we receive on our new resource and tool directories and incorporating that feedback into the Local Preservation School within the next few weeks. We're also working to incorporate the comments and suggestions we recieved through the workshops this fall. Thank you again to everyone who has already contributed to this project and we look forward to hearing your thoughts!
