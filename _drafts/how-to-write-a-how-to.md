For Digital Writing Month, we are writing a month of how-to guides for Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 and the Local Preservation School. Before we can begin, we need to know: **how do we write a how-to?**

For help, we turned to a presentation by Molly McLeod for the Code for America Summit: [Visual Communication 101: Writing and Designing Instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_2ZwoamCqaXzRvQpUL1vzC4nyl42Kks_nKpymjzIQBk/edit#slide=id.g9a353edf9_0_71). Molly recommends starting the process by answering four simple questions:

- Who are you writing for? 
- What do they need to know?
- What is the order they need to know it?
- What are the action steps?

Once we understand our audience and their needs, we can introduce our how-to (or instructions or tutorial) by answering for more questions for our readers: 

- Am I eligible? Is this relevant to me?
- What information or materials do I need on hand? Prerequisites?
- How long does it take?
- Key details: deadlines/when/where?

Finally, we are ready to write. Here are three recommendations to keep in mind:

- Write short sentences. Use simple words. Remove unneccesary words.
- Write in the active voice, where the person doing the action comes before the verb. Think of the reader as "you." Write instructions where the subject is "you," implied or understood. You don't have to state "you" directly. 
- When giving instructions that are more than one step, make each step an item in a numbered list. When instructions are not sequential steps, use separate paragraphs or simple bullets with bold beginnings rather than numbering.

Molly McLeod's presentation also includes some great recommendations on the visual design for instructions but we'll skip over that for right now. Instead, we are going to write our first how-to: how to contribute to the Local Preservation School project?
