We are back with a update on the Local Preservation School and a few more details on how you can get involved in the project. We are also excited to share a handful of prototypes and experiments that we’ve been working on over the past few months.

Over the past few months, we have been trying to answer a couple of big questions:

- What is the best way to teach people online?
- How do we create and distribute open educational resources?
- What open resources are already available for historic preservation? What related resources are available that we can adapt for people interested in preservation? 

## Teaching online

Not everyone has a year or two to dedicate to learning all of the nuts and bolts of historic preservation. How can the Local Preservation School offer 
There is an opportunity

## Collecting resources

So many resources already exist… why do we need another one? Good point! We don’t want to reinvent the wheel. Let’s see what is already available that we can reuse or remix for the Local Preservation School.

- Finding things
- Curating things
- Combining things

What is open?

The Local Preservation School is designed to meet the needs of volunteer preservation activists but we are not the only people working on this. We tried to find all of the

There is so much out there 

 We’ve continued to identify models for 


I presented the Local Preservation School project at the Openlab workshop in Crystal City, Virginia a few weeks ago – good practice for me to "sell" collaborators and contributors on the project. You can take a look at my slides and my notes or wait to see some of that again in the form of a short introductory video for the website.

To make it easier for people to participate (whether that means writing lessons, editing lessons or something else), I'm putting together a couple of "getting started" guides and shared resources where we could use help:
•	Getting Started with Open Educational Resources (working draft)  

•	Contribution Guidelines (in progress)
•	Resource Library (this publication list is my working draft but I also have a big list of historical NPS publications and a giant list of local history related PDFs scraped from a series of Google searches)
I have not given up on the plan to draft a Literacy Map and use stakeholder interviews to inform course development but I feel like starting with the pilot course is the best way to go. I also have a developing concept for a couple additional "prototype" courses that could fill out the Local Preservation School to the extent envisioned in our original proposal – one focused on how to address neighborhood-level preservation issues and another focused on capacity building, advocacy and communications for small heritage groups.

Explore Baltimore Heritage 101

We launched a survey for Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 to begin soliciting feedback from local audiences for an in-person version of the course that we are planning to launch in January. We have a prototype of the course site up and I started putting together a Trello board that will function as a syllabus/digital learning environment for course participants in January.

After we finish the facilitated version of the class in February, we will go back and revise the course site to make a final "Baltimore" version. In the spring, I'll take the Baltimore version and turn it into a more general resource – our first "course" for the Local Preservation School.

For that second iteration, I'm pursuing a potential partnership with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources to offer a version class to local historical societies in Virginia – hopefully giving us an opportunity to test and revise the course in the late spring or early summer. I've also reached out to CityLore about adapting/incorporating material from the Place Matters NYC Toolkit.
Neighborhood Toolkit
As part of my role as a board member for the Preservation Rightsizing Network, I've been working with Melissa Jest (National Trust for Historic Preservation) and Emilie Evans (formerly Michigan Historic Preservation Network now at Place Economics) to develop a toolkit of resources focused on historic neighborhoods in "Legacy Cities" like Baltimore, Rochester, Cleveland, etc. The toolkit is focused in part on the broader set of issues that affect historic neighborhoods and is modeled on a toolkit from the Center for Community Progress.
My current plan is to adapt the PRN toolkit into a local prototype focused on historic neighborhoods in Baltimore (working in partnership with a couple of community groups and nonprofit partners like the Community Law Center) with a particular focus on housing and community development issues.
Once we have completed a neighborhood toolkit for Baltimore, I plan on adapting the toolkit into a broader course for the Local Preservation School. For this revision process, I'm exploring partnerships with the Greater Philadelphia Preservation Alliance, the Los Angeles Conservancy and Brick + Beam Detroit.

Organizing/Advocacy/Designation Guide
The final prototype idea builds on my work as a board member for the Rainbow Heritage Network and our partnerships with community heritage groups in Baltimore (like the Northeast Baltimore History Roundtable and the Greater Hampden Heritage Alliance). With all of these groups, there are clear needs for capacity building, training on community organizing, a framework for advocacy, and accessible information on designation. I envision a similar approach of a local prototype (or a prototype for RHN) then converting that into a course for the Local Preservation School.
This idea is the least developed so far but I think there is clear potential for a partnerships with the new LGBTQ Heritage Preservation group in New York. I spoke to them at the NTHP meeting in November about the project and they are interested in collaborating!
Apologies for the long update – please feel free to send me some dates/times that may work for you.
