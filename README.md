# Local Preservation School
Local Preservation School: Tools, resources, and tutorials for saving historic places in your community. This repo contains [our project website](http://localpreservation.github.io). We are continuing to develop our [Local Preservation 101 course](https://github.com/localpreservation/course-in-a-box), the [Local Preservation handbook](https://github.com/localpreservation/handbook) and guidelines for contributors.

## What is the Local Preservation School?

The Local Preservation School is an **open learning environment** where preservation advocates and volunteers share with people how to save and sustain historic places in their communities. Our goal is to teach you how to get involved with historic preservation in your community through free online courses, easy-to-use tutorials and fun projects. **Beginners are welcome!**
