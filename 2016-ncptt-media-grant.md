We are writing a grant application and a guide to writing grant applications at the same time! Check out [our blog post for why we are doing this]({{ site.url }}/blog/ncptt-media-grant-application/), read on to see the grant application in progress, then share your comments with [Eli Pousson](http://twitter.com/elipousson). You can also creating issues in this repo or fork this repo to contribute edits directly.

## How to apply for a grant

This guide assumes that you have a project first‚Äîwhich is a good idea. Coming up with a project just for a grant is not always a bad idea but it can cause problems‚Äîespecially for small organizations. 

1. Find a grant opportunity
2. Read the description or announcement of the grant opportunity. There are several questions you need to answer before continuing:
  - Is my organization eligible to apply?
  - Is my project eligible?
  - When are applications due?
  - How do I apply?
  - How are they planning to review applications?
3. Read about the organization making the grant (optional). If you are not familiar with the grant-making organization, find and read their mission and core goals. It can sometimes be helpful to read about any listed staff members or board members to better understand what the organization does and who is helping to guide the organization's mission.
4. Contact a grant program administration by phone or email (optional but recommended). If you are still unsure if your project is suited to this grant opportunity, call or email a grant program administrator to discuss your project and any questions you may have. Grant administrators want to help you shape a competitive application!
5. Re-read the announcement and any related materials.
6. Create an outline based on the evaluation criteria for the grant narrative. Expand the outline with short descriptions or lists that explain how the proposed project meeting the requirements. **üëàThis is where we are at right now in preparing our 2016 NCPTT Media Grant application.**
7. Draft an abstract or project summary.
8. Revise and expand the outline to fit within the limits on words or pages. Some online submission forms use character counts to limit the length of submissions so make sure you know how much space you are allowed to explain your project.
9. Share your draft with a friend, colleague or partner (or more than one) to read for feedback and edits. Pay special attention to the clarity of organization, maintaining a direct connection between the narrative and the grant criteria, as well as spelling and grammar. Small mistakes (like mispelling the name of a partner organization) can undermine the credibility of an otherwise compelling proposal.
10. Revise the narrative one last time based on the feedback you recieved.
11. Collect any additional attachments that may be required. Typical requirements include financial statements, resumes or CVs, 501c3 certification letters, etc. 
12. Submit your grant application!

One last step: send thank-you notes to anyone who helped you with the grant application and mark your calendar for the date when you expect you might hear back.

# NCPTT 2016 Media Grant Application

## Project Title

Local Preservation School

- Should we give this project a tagline or a longer more descriptive title?

## Project Abstract: Tell us about this project in 100 words or less

Here is what NCPTT says is required for the **abstract**:

> The abstract is a summary of proposed work suitable for dissemination to the public. It is limited to 100 words in length. The project abstract will be a file attachment in the application. Please create the file in Microsoft Word or Word compatible software.   

## Project Narrative: Tell us about this project is 10 pages or less  

Here is what NCPTT says is required for the **narrative description**:

> The proposal is a narrative description that should specifically address each of the review criteria (see Section IV). The proposal text must be no longer than 10 pages, no smaller than font size 11, and have 1-inch margins. The 10-page limit includes all text, figures, references, and resumes (Forms SF-424, SF-424A, SF- 424B, project abstract, key contacts, and the statement of indirect charges are not counted as part of the 10 page limit).

I‚Äôm estimating that resumes, references and figures will take about 3-4 pages of the total. That leaves us to write (or reuse) around 6-7 pages of description to explain this project. I‚Äôm going to start with an outline of the key components of our project and how they fulfill the goals for the grant. It is always good to make this very explicit‚Äîdon‚Äôt assume a grant reviewer will understand why your project is a good fit for a funding opportunity? You _always_ have to tell them.

## Project Description

Baltimore Heritage proposes to develop and deliver a MOOC (massively open online course) focused on teaching historic preservation tools and practices that can be used at the community level to preserve and enhance historic places. The course is intended for a diverse audience of historic preservation advocates, with a particular focus on underserved and non-professional communities in urban areas. This project will take the form of a set of teaching resources published online as public domain content using the GitHub platform for sharing open-source code and documents.

**What do we think makes this a compelling project?**

- There are few existing models for collaborative, open-source projects related to historic preservation. This project could help increase the base of preservation professionals using GitHub with potential secondary benefits for other open-source projects in the future.
- Open education is increasing in importance across the country. The White House also just [announced a major initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/10/19/openly-licensed-educational-resources-providing-equitable-access-education-all) to support the ‚Äúuse of open educational resources to provide equitable access to quality education.‚Äù
- Other federal agencies are using and promoting open-source tools, notably 18F, but also the White House, the National Park Service (of which NCPTT is part), etc.

## Innovation

**Does the proposal offer a media product for disseminating innovative technology to the preservation community?**

The media product offered by this project is a collection of tutorials, resources and lessons for preservation advocates (including both professionals and volunteers). This product is a model of how our innovative technology and approach‚Äîusing open-source and GitHub pages to rely on community-driven 

**How does this product disseminate preservation technology?**

It disseminates preservation technology in to ways:
- By engaging professional and experienced volunteers in the process of developing lessons, commenting and contributing to lessons through social media and open-source publishing tools.
- By connecting interested audiences with resources that demonstrate the potential of these open-source methods for creating effective educational resources.

**How does the preservation community benefit from this product?¬†**

Benefits:
- Increased accessibility of free resources
- Builds capacity to contribute to other open-source initiatives through familiarity with open-source principals and tools.
- Project supports related efforts to create a more diverse and participatory culture within preservation practice.  

**Why is the choice of media (publication, mobile application, video) the most appropriate way to disseminate the information or gather resource data?¬†**

Examples:
- P2PU
- 18F

**Are there similar media products that are currently available to the public? How does the proposed media product differ?¬†**

Examples:
- Local
	- Toolkit
- Statewide
	- Minnesota [Preservation 101](http://www.mnpreservation.org/resources-page/preservation-guides/)
	- Oregon [Preservation 101 Slides](http://www.oregon.gov/oprd/HCD/SHPO/docs/2012OMSConf/MS_4_HP101.pdf)
	- New York [Workshop Syllabus](http://www.preservationbuffaloniagara.org/files/documents/Preservation_101/Preservation_101_for_Web_SHPO_w_logos.pdf)

Our proposed product differs with an open license, web-based interactive features (no PDFs, no proprietary LMS, no PPT, etc.)

## National Need

**How does this project address a wide range of preservation needs?**

- We are planning to recruit and support collaborators and contributors from a variety of locations and backgrounds in creating these resources; with the goal of serving a variety of audiences. 
- Opportunities for participation, responsiveness to feedback.
- Ability to fork and adapt materials as needed.

**How are the project results applicable to more than one cultural resource?¬†**

Our educational resources will be developed with consideration for regional variation in public policy and historic resources. We plan to help people who are  using the resources to understand how their interests fit within a typology of building/resource types and broad categories of preservation issues. Topics under development that relate to more than one community include:

- Strategies for vacant and abandoned properties
- Strategies for public art/monuments
- Documentation and designation of diverse resources (intangible resources,  underrepresented resources, LGBTQ, African American, women‚Äôs rights, Latino, Asian American/Pacific Islander, etc.)

## Audience

**Who is the target audience for the product?**

Here are the range of **potential audiences** we are considering:

- **middle, high school or college-age students¬†**with an interest in pursuing careers in historic preservation or related fields
- **early to mid-career professionals working in historic preservation**, including local, state, federal government; local, statewide, and regional non-profits; and private businesses in cultural resource management, architecture and conservation
- **early to mid-career professionals working in related fields**, including museums, tourism, community and economic development, folklore, urban and regional planning, sustainable transportation advocacy, community organizing, etc.
- **volunteer historic preservation advocates**, including volunteers with historic sites, advocacy groups, and local preservation commissioners
- **residents of historic communities¬†**with an interest or concern for issues related to community development (e.g. vacancy, illegal dumping, underutilizing buildings) or particular historic resources (e.g. a historic school or library, a historic church)
- **owners of historic properties** including religious congregations, fraternal or social clubs, elected officials with local/state government, public employees in capital planning or property management programs, small developers and investors.

We see the **primary target audience** for this project as:

- volunteer historic preservation advocates
- early to mid-career professionals working in related fields

We see the **secondary target audience** for this project as:

- early to mid-career professionals working in historic preservation

This secondary audience may be using these resources to educate themselves or as a resource to support their own teaching/education efforts, e.g. leading workshops, linking to resources in correspondence with partners, etc. 

Our resources will also be organized around **specific audience needs and goals**. Different [learning pathways](http://edglossary.org/learning-pathway/) could include:

- how to research and document historic buildings and neighborhoods
- how to organize heritage program for neighborhood residents
- how to plan and execute an advocacy campaign to protect a threatened landmark

**Provide a distribution plan to reach the target audience.¬†**

Direct strategies for distribution:

- Social media for Local Preservation School
- Email newsletter for Local Preservation School
- Conference workshops at local/statewide preservation conferences
- Partnerships with national/statewide/local preservation advocacy organizations

Indirect strategies for distribution:

- Encouraging social media promotion by contributors, collaborators and learners

## Costs

**How do the benefits of the project relate to the proposed budget?¬†**

The existing project funding ($70,000) is budgeted for:

- Travel/conference expenses for project team/collaborators
- Contract services (writing, editing, instructional design)

Additional project funding:

- Instructional Designer
- Web Development (requires experience GitHub, open-source projects, HMTL/CSS, Javascript)
- Open Source Community Manager
- Content Marketing

## Schedule

- Fall 2015
- Winter 2015/2016
- Spring 2016
- Summer 2016
- Fall 2016
- Winter 2016/2017

## Deliverables

We propose to divide the project into four major components:

- A preservation literacy map
- A database of OERs (Open Educational Resources) for preservation 
- A pilot hybrid course for Baltimore participants ([Explore Baltimore Heritage 101](https://github.com/baltimoreheritage/explore-101))
- An set of lessons for participants around the U.S. ‚Äì this may take the form of a single course (e.g. [Local Preservation 101](https://github.com/localpreservation/course-in-a-box)) or multiple short courses (e.g. [Local Data and Preservation](https://github.com/localpreservation/localdata-101))

The fourth component is the largest: an online "school" with multiple short courses or lessons presented as a national resource with a focus on urban and suburban communities. The school will initially be launched as a facilitated 8-week course with the goal of reaching around 200 participants in cities around the country. Each lesson will include course material, such as suggested resources, activities that can be completed online or in a participant's own community, and some strategy for evaluation, such as a short quiz. 

Optionally, sections of the online course could be designed as templates that local partners could "fork" and adapt for the needs of audiences in their own community. Alternate names for the site include School of Saving Places, School of Heritage Conservation, and the School of Community Heritage.

## Qualifications

What makes Baltimore Heritage a competitive applicant as the project lead?

- We are a small organization where even modest investments in funding can make a big difference for our capacity.
- We now have a track record of successful federal grants thanks to the Baltimore Heritage archaeological dig in Patterson Park in 2014. 

What about our broader network of advisors, partners, contacts and friends make this a more competitive project?

- This project is based around open communications with professionals and volunteers around the country.
