## How do you apply for a grant?

This guide assumes that you have a project first—which is a good idea. Coming up with a project just for a grant is not always a bad idea but it can cause problems—especially for small organizations. 

1. Find a grant opportunity
2. Read the description or announcement of the grant opportunity. There are several questions you need to answer before continuing:
  - Is my organization eligible to apply?
  - Is my project eligible?
  - When are applications due?
  - How do I apply?
  - How are they planning to review applications?
3. Read about the organization making the grant (optional). If you are not familiar with the grant-making organization, find and read their mission and core goals. It can sometimes be helpful to read about any listed staff members or board members to better understand what the organization does and who is helping to guide the organization's mission.
4. Contact a grant program administration by phone or email (optional but recommended). If you are still unsure if your project is suited to this grant opportunity, call or email a grant program administrator to discuss your project and any questions you may have. Grant administrators want to help you shape a competitive application!
5. Re-read the announcement and any related materials.
6. Create an outline based on the evaluation criteria for the grant narrative. Expand the outline with short descriptions or lists that explain how the proposed project meeting the requirements.
7. Draft a project summary. **:point_left: This is where we are at right now in preparing our 2016 NCPTT Media Grant application.**
8. Revise and expand the outline to fit within the limits on words or pages. Some online submission forms use character counts to limit the length of submissions so make sure you know how much space you are allowed to explain your project.
9. Share your draft with a friend, colleague or partner (or more than one) to read for feedback and edits. Pay special attention to the clarity of organization, maintaining a direct connection between the narrative and the grant criteria, as well as spelling and grammar. Small mistakes (like mispelling the name of a partner organization) can undermine the credibility of an otherwise compelling proposal.
10. Revise the narrative one last time based on the feedback you recieved.
11. Collect any additional attachments that may be required. Typical requirements include financial statements, resumes or CVs, 501c3 certification letters, etc. 
12. Submit your grant application!

One last step: send thank-you notes to anyone who helped you with the grant application and mark your calendar for the date when you expect you might hear back.

## Local Preservation School: Project Description

### Introduction

Local Preservation School is an online open educational resource (OER) designed to teach historic preservation concepts, skills and practices to volunteer and professional preservation advocates. Over the next year, we plan to develop a collection of lessons, exercises, activities illustrated with interactive maps, quizzes, graphics and data visualizations that can be used by a diverse community of preservation advocates around the country as learning resources. Preservation professionals can also use (and customize) these same resources to teach interested individuals in their own communities about how to participate in historic preservation efforts in a variety of ways.

This proposal continues to explain how the Local Preservation School disseminates innovative technology, addresses a national need, identifies an audience (with a plan to reach them), and clearly justifies project costs. In summary:

1. This project disseminates a unique model for how GitHub, Jekyll and open-source web technologies can facilitate affordable, effective and collaborative preservation advocacy and education. Our planned educational resources include both lessons on how to use open-source tools for preservation (e.g. Omeka, Open Street Map, and geojson.io) and templates and guidelines for how teachers can create their own lessons with GitHub and Jekyll.
2. This project addresses a wide range of needs with a collaborative approach for content development—including professionals/volunteers from different cities and regions who have experience with wide variety of cultural resources. We seek to balance this broad and inclusive scope by envisioning a design and user experience that can allow any individual to customize their learning experience—matching beginners to introductory lessons or experienced advocates to advanced tutorials.
3. After a detailed review of existing online educational resources, we identified volunteer historic preservation advocates as the primary audience for the Local Preservation School resources—an audience we believe to be underserved by existing resources. We identified early to mid-career professionals working in fields related to historic preservation (tourism, community and economic development, urban planning, etc.) as a secondary audience—recognizing their role as frequent collaborators with volunteer and professional preservation advocates. Early to mid-career professionals working in historic preservation are a final audience for the project, serving as collaborators, contributors and advisors as we develop the course content and guidelines for teaching and collaboration.
4. The project funding requested under this grant proposal would support the addition of key partners to the project team, including an instructional designer with experience in online education and a web developer with open-source project management experience.

To illustrate the enormous potential of the innovative open-source technology that supports the Local Preservation School we have used GitHub to publish this grant application and engage a broader community of partners in the development of the proposal through our Jekyll-based website at: [localpreservation.github.io/2016-ncptt-media-grant](localpreservation.github.io/2016-ncptt-media-grant).

The remaining section of the proposal provides additional background on how the Local Preservation School uses and disseminates technology, what preservation needs and audiences it addresses and explains the project costs. The description is followed by 

### Technology and Dissemination Strategy

**Does the proposal offer a media product for disseminating innovative technology to the preservation community?**

The media product offered by this project is a collection of tutorials, resources and lessons for preservation advocates (including both professionals and volunteers). This product is a model of how our innovative technology and approach—using open-source and GitHub pages to rely on community-driven 

**How does this product disseminate preservation technology?**

It disseminates preservation technology in to ways:

- By engaging professional and experienced volunteers in the process of developing lessons, commenting and contributing to lessons through social media and open-source publishing tools.
- By connecting interested audiences with resources that demonstrate the potential of these open-source methods for creating effective educational resources.

**How does the preservation community benefit from this product? **

Benefits:
- Increased accessibility of free resources
- Builds capacity to contribute to other open-source initiatives through familiarity with open-source principals and tools.
- Project supports related efforts to create a more diverse and participatory culture within preservation practice.  

**Why is the choice of media (publication, mobile application, video) the most appropriate way to disseminate the information or gather resource data? **

Examples:
- P2PU
- 18F

**Are there similar media products that are currently available to the public? How does the proposed media product differ? **

Examples:
- Local
	- Toolkit
- Statewide
	- Minnesota [Preservation 101](http://www.mnpreservation.org/resources-page/preservation-guides/)
	- Oregon [Preservation 101 Slides](http://www.oregon.gov/oprd/HCD/SHPO/docs/2012OMSConf/MS_4_HP101.pdf)
	- New York [Workshop Syllabus](http://www.preservationbuffaloniagara.org/files/documents/Preservation_101/Preservation_101_for_Web_SHPO_w_logos.pdf)

Our proposed product differs with an open license, web-based interactive features (no PDFs, no proprietary LMS, no PPT, etc.)

### Preservation Needs and Audiences

**How does this project address a wide range of preservation needs?**

- We are planning to recruit and support collaborators and contributors from a variety of locations and backgrounds in creating these resources; with the goal of serving a variety of audiences. 
- Opportunities for participation, responsiveness to feedback.
- Ability to fork and adapt materials as needed.

**How are the project results applicable to more than one cultural resource? **

Our educational resources will be developed with consideration for regional variation in public policy and historic resources. We plan to help people who are  using the resources to understand how their interests fit within a typology of building/resource types and broad categories of preservation issues. Topics under development that relate to more than one community include:

- Strategies for vacant and abandoned properties
- Strategies for public art/monuments
- Documentation and designation of diverse resources (intangible resources,  underrepresented resources, LGBTQ, African American, women’s rights, Latino, Asian American/Pacific Islander, etc.)

**Who is the target audience for the product?**

Here are the range of **potential audiences** we are considering:

- **middle, high school or college-age students **with an interest in pursuing careers in historic preservation or related fields
- **early to mid-career professionals working in historic preservation**, including local, state, federal government; local, statewide, and regional non-profits; and private businesses in cultural resource management, architecture and conservation
- **early to mid-career professionals working in related fields**, including museums, tourism, community and economic development, folklore, urban and regional planning, sustainable transportation advocacy, community organizing, etc.
- **volunteer historic preservation advocates**, including volunteers with historic sites, advocacy groups, and local preservation commissioners
- **residents of historic communities **with an interest or concern for issues related to community development (e.g. vacancy, illegal dumping, underutilizing buildings) or particular historic resources (e.g. a historic school or library, a historic church)
- **owners of historic properties** including religious congregations, fraternal or social clubs, elected officials with local/state government, public employees in capital planning or property management programs, small developers and investors.

We see the **primary target audience** for this project as:

- volunteer historic preservation advocates
- early to mid-career professionals working in related fields

We see the **secondary target audience** for this project as:

- early to mid-career professionals working in historic preservation

This secondary audience may be using these resources to educate themselves or as a resource to support their own teaching/education efforts, e.g. leading workshops, linking to resources in correspondence with partners, etc. 

Our resources will also be organized around **specific audience needs and goals**. Different [learning pathways](http://edglossary.org/learning-pathway/) could include:

- how to research and document historic buildings and neighborhoods
- how to organize heritage program for neighborhood residents
- how to plan and execute an advocacy campaign to protect a threatened landmark

**Provide a distribution plan to reach the target audience. **

Direct strategies for distribution:

- Social media for Local Preservation School
- Email newsletter for Local Preservation School
- Conference workshops at local/statewide preservation conferences
- Partnerships with national/statewide/local preservation advocacy organizations

Indirect strategies for distribution:

- Encouraging social media promotion by contributors, collaborators and learners

### Costs

**How do the benefits of the project relate to the proposed budget? **

The existing project funding ($70,000) is budgeted for:

- Travel/conference expenses for project team/collaborators
- Contract services (writing, editing, instructional design)

Additional project funding:

- Instructional Designer
- Web Development (requires experience GitHub, open-source projects, HMTL/CSS, Javascript)
- Open Source Community Manager
- Content Marketing

## Local Preservation School: Schedule
_Length: 69 of 500 words_ 

This is a summary description that needs to be expanded.

We've been meaning to put together an updated schedule anyway! A grant application can be a great opportunity for project planning even if an application is not successful in winning funding. A project schedule can sometimes start or end before or after a grant begins to illustrate the broader context when a grant is supporting an existing initiative.

## Local Preservation School: Deliverables
_Length: 403 of 500 words_ 

We plan to create three major deliverables for this project:

1. A preservation literacy map
2. A database of OERs (Open Educational Resources) for preservation 
3. A set of beginner-focused lessons for participants around the U.S. – this may take the form of a single course (e.g. [Local Preservation 101](https://github.com/localpreservation/course-in-a-box)) or multiple short courses (e.g. [Local Data and Preservation](https://github.com/localpreservation/localdata-101))

The **Preservation Literacy Map** is a detailed outline describing competencies, skills and knowledge that people need to have in order to be effective advocates for historic preservation. The Literacy Map is intended to provide an overarching curriculum for the Local Preservation School, guiding the organization of the resource database and online lessons while connecting people to the most relevant resources for their area of interest. The concept of a “literacy map” as a core guiding document for this project is inspired by the Mozilla Webmaker project’s[ Web Literacy Map](https://webmaker.org/en-US/literacy). The intent of the Web Literacy Map is to help people “build literacy in exploring, building, and sharing the web” by describing “powers like coding, storytelling, protecting your online privacy” and connecting those skills to related links “hands on projects to make and activities for teaching.” As with Mozilla’s project, the Preservation Literacy Map will allow people to determine what skills they have, what skills they lack and how to find resources to improve their confident in those areas.

The **Preservation Resource Database** is a collection of documents, websites, tools and related material available under open licenses (public domain or Creative Commons). The database enables the presentation of related resources depending on resource type, location, publisher, date, etc. 

The **Local Preservation School** builds on the literacy map and resource database to deliver multiple short courses or focused on a national audience of people interested in historic preservation in urban and suburban communities. We plan to involve 30-50 preservation professionals and volunteers in the collaborative development of the course content and presentation. The school will initially be launched as a facilitated 8-week course with the goal of reaching around 200 participants in cities around the country. Each lesson will include course material, such as suggested resources, activities that can be completed online or in a participant's own community, and some strategy for evaluation, such as a short quiz. We plan to design selected lessons in the form of templates that local partners could "fork" using GitHub to adapt for the needs of audiences in their own community.

## Local Preservation School: Qualifications
_Length: 463 of 500 words_

The development for the Local Preservation School does not follow the model suggested in the application guidelines of a principal investigator and research team. Instead, this project is organized and facilitated by Eli Pousson, Director of Preservation and Outreach for Baltimore Heritage. In this project, Eli Pousson is closely coordinating with Baltimore Heritage Executive Director Johns Hopkins and Barbara Little, Program Manager, Cultural Resources Office of Outreach, Diversity and Inclusion, National Park Service (who initiated the development of this program and provided funding through NCSHPO). 
Baltimore Heritage is a small nonprofit with a strong track record of successful community outreach and digital history projects with a mix of support from private, state and federal funding. As a long-time participant in the National Trust for Historic Preservation Statewide and Local Partners program, we anticipate drawing significant support for this project through our relationships and past partnerships with preservation professionals and volunteers around the country.

Beyond this core project team, we plan to solicit participation from 20-30 preservation professional and volunteers from local and state government and private nonprofits. Partners contacted prior to the submission of this application include the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, City Lore (a New York City-based cultural heritage nonprofit), the National Trust for Historic Preservation, San Antonio Conservation Society and others.

Eli has worked for Baltimore Heritage since 2009. He previously worked for the DC Office of Historic Preservation and completed graduate work in anthropology and historic preservation at the University of Maryland College Park. Recent projects for Baltimore Heritage include:

- Leading the development of Explore Baltimore Heritage: A website and native smartphone app created Curatescape and Omeka that combines accessible interpretive essays with historic images from archives and libraries across the Baltimore region.
- Coordinating We Dig Hampstead Hill – Searching for the War of 1812 in Patterson Park: A public archaeology dig in a major East Baltimore park that engaged over 70 volunteers and 700 school children in the spring of 2014.
- Serving as the primary historian on Baltimore’s Civil Rights Heritage: Looking for Landmarks from the Movement: A NPS Heritage Fund supported project to write a Multiple Property Documentation Form about Civil Rights associated resources for the Maryland Historical Trust.

In addition to his work with Baltimore Heritage, Eli volunteers as a board member of the Friends of Maryland’s Olmsted Parks & Landscapes, a founding member of the Preservation Rightsizing Network, and a founding board member of the Rainbow Heritage Network.

Johns Hopkins has been the executive director of Baltimore Heritage since 2003. Before that, Johns worked for the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development developing and implementing smart growth and neighborhood revitalization programs. Johns holds degrees from Yale University, George Washington University Law School, and the University of Michigan’s School of Natural Resources and Environment.
