The Community Preservation Guide is an educational resource for people interested in learning how local preservationists can build more inclusive programs, advocacy campaigns, and organizations.

This resource is based on several publications by the National Trust for Historic Preservation including:

- Developing a Grassroots Network from the Advocacy Training Manual by the Center for State and Local Policy ([PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByRNPnSQ-I35YVAtUC1JdnBiWWM))
- Working with an Advocacy Coalition ([PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByRNPnSQ-I35ZXc4eERxem1mamc)) from the Advocacy Training Manual by the Center for State and Local Policy
- Fundraising Basics for Preservation Organizations by Martha Vail for Preservation Books ([PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByRNPnSQ-I35TlUwSmkwbVN3em8))

We are in the process of refining and expanding this resource based on feedback collection during our DC Study Group organized in partnership with the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the D.C. Preservation League on December 10, 2016. Slides from the workshop are [available online](https://localpreservation.github.io/presentations/2016-12-09-localpastdc.html#/) and notes from the workshop are available in this [shared Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yEhfL5ZMtweAcIHSSBL3IKmOat0Kgp0eDgx1czlXww/edit).
