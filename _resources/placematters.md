While there are no sure ways to protect a place, Place Matters created this Toolkit to help people nationwide to:

- Identify the cultural and historical functions of places that matter;
- Find ways to capture and use that information to protect them;
- Share the strategies that people have often found effective in preserving places that matter.

When you preserve places that matter, youâ€™re protecting our shared history, memories, traditions, and the continuing use of these places into the future.
