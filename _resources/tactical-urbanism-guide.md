title: "Tactical Urbanist's Guide to Materials & Design"
excerpt: "Tactical Urbanism is an approach to neighborhood building that uses short-term, low-cost, and scalable interventions and policies to catalyze long term change."
description: "Tactical Urbanism helps advance many kinds of projects, but the purpose of this guide is to provide materials and design guidance for projects that advance street safety and enhance place making efforts in both the short- and longterm. To do so, this guide recommends breaking down the conventional, often drawn-out project delivery process into discrete, incremental time intervals. This allows for faster implementation, broader public engagement, and more flexibility in project duration and level of investment so that safer streets and public spaces can be created now!"
