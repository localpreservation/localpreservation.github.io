We are putting together a reading list along with recommended videos, audio documentaries, and other resources that would be useful and interesting to people who are interested in learning more about historic preservation. These resources are drawn from our own research for the Local Preservation School and our Syllabus Directory available as a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kw6s6bolJS5Ju5G1vxZLLdrjB3XuoU0moQIjjpyTmOk/edit?usp=sharing) which includes syllabi on topics including:

- Architectural History
- Museum Studies
- Building Trades
- Oral History
- Archaeology
- Material Culture
- Folklore
- Urban/Regional Planning
- Archival Studies
- Cultural Resource Management
- Historic Preservation Law & Policy
